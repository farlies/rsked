# Contributing to Rsked

`rsked` is a project with a relatively narrow focus: providing weekly
audio entertainment to persons and sites that cannot effectively control 
a general purpose music player, and might not have consistent internet
access.

If you share this (or a nearby) use case, and have the time, interest, and
skills, the part-time `rsked` staff would welcome contributions.

If you just have a question not answered by the documentation, email
farlies at gmail.com.

## Ways to contribute

- Report bugs (GitHub Issues); note version, architecture, relevant log messages
- Suggest operational features
- Propose patches, either as a pull requests or (small) diffs sent to farlies
- Design and evaluate embedded hardware options

If you're keen to make more extensive contributions, please get in touch.
