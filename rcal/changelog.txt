5.9.20
- Split the CSS content from the style tag to its own file, styles.css
- Added announcement menu with appropriate new ids + CSS
- Changed display mode to a 4x4 grid model, with the menus in the left-hand column and the calendar on the right

6.9.20
- Created an array of test announcements in testdata.js
- Started adding calendar table elements to eedit.html, added link to full calendarâ€™s main.js script

7.9.20
- Removed edit buttons from announcement menu as discussed

9.9.20
- Added remaining calendar elements
- Adjusted the modal's z-index from 1 to 3 so it will float on top of the calendar events
- Adjusted some CSS for the calendar toolbar

11.9.20
- Added fc-event-draggable class to events in the sourcelist in preparation for drag and drop

18.9.20
- Added some dummy buttons to the calendar toolbar that can be used for saving and loading the schedule
- Halfheartedly added some fullcalendar-esque styling on the source menu and buttons that I'll definitely change later
- Added some functions to rcal.js to import and display the default announcements in the announcement list
- Made some small tweaks to the way events look in the fullcalendar main.css - was sick of looking at those blue borders
- Stripped out some unnecessary features from the calendar html (for instance, specific date data and today/past/future classes)

???
- Changed the announcement colour from yellow to purple for legibility

7.10.20
- Decided to replace the static HTML calendar with a dynamically generated one using the fullcalendar scripts
(cleans up the HTML significantly, and makes other calendar functions work properly without as much faff)
- Calendar now is generated on page load into the calendar-widget div and automatically scrolls to 6am
- Toolbar buttons (Save, Load, Clear) also now generated on load using FC's custom button script - currently they just generate a little pop-up that does nothing

7.10.20 ROUND 2!
- Implemented drag-and-drop for sources and announcements. Currently you can drag events onto the calendar, but you cannot
delete them by dragging them off. Have not added any default settings for these events, so they're using FC defaults.
- Made the 'Clear' button functional, it now will clear all the events off the calendar.
- Added a title tag to the head of the HTML doc - feel free to change it
- Slightly changed the HTML structure of the source panel to simplify the drag-and-drop script - have nested both
the standard source list and the announcement list into one div called external-events - updated CSS to match

22.2.21
- Events dragged to calendar now take on the colour of the source they were dragged from
- Implemented a basic version of the event modal that can be opened by clicking on a calendar event

11.3.21
- Clear button now triggers a confirmation popup as a precaution before clearing the schedule

21.7.21
- Integrated schedule saving and loading features.
