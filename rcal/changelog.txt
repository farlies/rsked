5.9.20
- Split the CSS content from the style tag to its own file, styles.css
- Added announcement menu with appropriate new ids + CSS
- Changed display mode to a 4x4 grid model, with the menus in the left-hand column and the calendar on the right
6.9.20
- Created an array of test announcements in testdata.js
- Started adding calendar table elements to eedit.html, added link to full calendarâ€™s main.js script
7.9.20
- Removed edit buttons from announcement menu as discussed
9.9.20
- Added remaining calendar elements
- Adjusted the modal's z-index from 1 to 3 so it will float on top of the calendar events
- Adjusted some CSS for the calendar toolbar
11.9.20
- Added fc-event-draggable class to events in the sourcelist in preparation for drag and drop
18.9.20
- Added some dummy buttons to the calendar toolbar that can be used for saving and loading the schedule
- Halfheartedly added some fullcalendar-esque styling on the source menu and buttons that I'll definitely change later
- Added some functions to rcal.js to import and display the default announcements in the announcement list
- Made some small tweaks to the way events look in the fullcalendar main.css - was sick of looking at those blue borders
- Stripped out some unnecessary features from the calendar html (for instance, specific date data and today/past/future classes)
???
- Changed the announcement colour from yellow to purple for legibility
7.10.20
- Decided to replace the static HTML calendar with a dynamically generated one using the fullcalendar scripts
(cleans up the HTML significantly, and makes other calendar functions work properly without as much faff)
- Calendar now is generated on page load into the calendar-widget div and automatically scrolls to 6am
- Toolbar buttons (Save, Load, Clear) also now generated on load using FC's custom button script - currently they just generate a little pop-up that does nothing
